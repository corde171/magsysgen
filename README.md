Unique Magic System Generator

Overview: 
MagSysGen is a generator for random, unique magic systems for video games and the like. It is aimed at games where discovery by the player of spells and components is a focus, and that the ability to look up spells and components would be detrimental to the overall experience. However, it can also be used once to generate a magic system for a game, novel, or movie that, while distinct from other media's systems, is the same across the board.

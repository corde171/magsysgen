# Magic System Structure:

## Power Source:
- Intrinsic Mana
- Ambient Mana
- Extrinsic Mana
- Emotions
 
## Spell Schools (Each is a yes/no; single spell words can be added or removed manually):
- Evocation (create energy* of a specific type, etc.)
  - Healing is a subschool here, because life energy is healing
  - Reanimation is a subschool here, because energy is used to manipulate matter
- Conjuration (temporarily/permanently create objects of a specific kind, etc.)
- Illusion (alter how an object/entity appears to others in terms of the energy it gives off, like how it looks, what it sounds like, what aura it has)
- Abjuration (counter energy* of a specific type or any magic, usually to defend; this isn't shielding, it's stopping the magic from doing what it would do/cutting people off from access to magic)
- Mind Arts** (manipulate the minds of others or defend your mind from the manipulations of others)
- Alchemy (putting magical and/or non-magical ingredients together to get magical potions, etc.) 
- Transmutation (permanently transforming objects)
- Enchantment (making normal things magic and cool)

## System Quirks (some can be combined, but not all may be able to be):
- Magic User Duality (one part of mages can use some kinds of magic better or at all, and the other uses the other kinds better or at all; if you've read the Wheel of Time, this is a generalized form of _saidar_ and _saidin_)
- Mage Penalty (more permanent cost to using magic; can be shorter lifespan, weaker body, etc.)

## Casting Methods (one or more of the following):
- Runes
- Verbal casting
- Somatic casting

## Requirements (0 or more of the following):
- Arcane Focus (wand, crystal, staff, etc. that doesn't necessarily store magic, but focuses it)
- Spell Components (magic plants/dusts/etc. needed for spells)

## Membership Restrictions (who can use magic; choose one):
- Innate random (born with it, doesn't follow bloodline)
- Innate inherited (born with it, follows bloodline somehow)
- Anyone, with practice
- Anyone
- Anyone who makes a pact with a powerful entity/swears fealty to magical organization

### Restriction Add-ons:
- Certain age groups (maybe only after turning a certain age, or magic stops being powerful/available after a certain age)
- Certain other groups (maybe humans don't have magic and elves do, or only women can use magic, or only human males can use it while only elven females can)


### Footnotes:
- *While contrary to our world's understanding of temperature, making things freeze is considered a kind of energy here (thus allowing frost to be its own type)
- **If you've read Harry Potter, basically Legilimency and Occlumency
